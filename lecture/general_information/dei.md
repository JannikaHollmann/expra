# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

## What does diversity, equity and inclusion mean?
Good question: these terms are closely related to each other but don't mean the same. But you could say that one can not exist without the others.
We will define each term following:

### Diversity
- the presence of different (*diverse*) characteristics like
  - age
  - gender
  - ethnicity
  - skin color
  - culture
  - class
  - disability
  - sexual orientation
  - religion
  - etc.

 :::{dropdown} Metacognitive Moments :brain:
:open:
- Which voices, perspectives or identities are visible in my work space or private live - which are not?
- How do I react to people with different experiences, values or backgrounds than mine and why?
- Which implicit biases might influence how I perceive diversity?
:::

### Equity
- equity refers to the German term "Chancengleichheit"; meaning that in a diverse society every member should have the same chances independently of his/her characteristics

 :::{dropdown} Metacognitive Moments :brain:
:open:
- Do I have access to the same academic resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities as my peers – and is that true for everyone in my cohort?
- Where do I notice systemic barriers in academia or training that might disadvantage certain groups of students or researchers?
- Do I sometimes confuse “treating everyone the same” with “ensuring fairness”? How might this distinction play out in university settings or future clinical practice?
:::

### Inclusion
- Inclusion finally means to create an environment, where equity and diversity can be lived.

 :::{dropdown} Metacognitive Moments :brain:
:open:
- What steps can I take to encourage classmates to share their perspectives without fear of judgment or exclusion?
- How do I respond when someone is subtly or openly excluded in academic or professional settings?
- Which everyday behaviors – in language, group discussions, or decision-making – can foster greater inclusion in my academic community?
:::

## Why should I care?
First, at least *some* things have changed in the last years in academia concerning **diversity, equity and inclusion** like
- all applications for research fundings in Europe have to report on DEI in their proposed research projects
- there is a Committee for Gender Balance and Diversity in Research in Norway

But ... have we really achieved equity in Germany and Psychology? https://his-he.de/publikationen/vielfalt-an-hochschulen/ 
Is there really equity when
- 18.4 % of professorships in MINT studies are held by women
- the focus of diversity in higher academia is sex and social background
- Psychology is based on a white eurocentric perspective
- the subjects race and ethnicity are underrepresented in peer-reviewed psychological publications
- the majority of psychological knowledge is based on WEIRD populations
- in psychology BIPOC students are underrepresented
## new outline
- definition of diversity, equity and inclusion
  - maybe inclusion as one of the human rights?
- why it is important (here we could just use this text) 
  - could include statistics on hiring biases, drop-off in gender ratio for women in higher positions in academia -> representation gap -> unconscious bias, foreign students in germany; maybe a german version of this -> https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15413446251335574
  - positive effects of DEI?
- what can we do? (Some of these could be covered in the CoC)
  - APA bias free language
  - interactive materials
    - maybe pick one or two good sources. Ideally related to fostering awareness 
  - initiatives? (would put those with resources down below)
- summary and more resources


Let's rip one band-aid off right away: the current scientific and academic system is incredibly flawed and tremendously biased. Unfortunately, most students are not brought into contact with the respective issues during their studies and thus quite often perceive the present inequalities as "normal" and a given. This lead to the proliferation of exceptionally unfair "standards" and practices towards minorities and underrepresented groups. What's needed to combat these things are Universities, Departments, Lecturers, etc. that address these issues, as well as inform and enable students to actively engage in the process towards increasing [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(business)) ([#DEI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEI?src=hashtag_click)) at all levels. 

You might think: "Why should I care and what does it have to do with me? I just want to study.". Well, even though you might not be (knowingly) affected, someone you know most likely will be and it will take all of us to change this for the better. In order to become aware of the systemic problems and issues others are facing and take corresponding actions, one needs to be able to make informed decisions based on a broad foundation of knowledge and this needs to be enabled asap. 

Please take the time and effort to delve into this crucial topic by checking the resources linked below and utilizing them as a starting point. Please note that these things will be frequently updated. If you stumble across something that should be included, please contact the instructor so that it can be added.

### Interactive materials

More and more information concerning this important topic is also provided via interactive materials, i.e. shiny apps, that allow a more in-depth exploration. Sometimes add-ons to journal publications, sometimes independent work or repositories, sometimes based on other resources, these materials present interesting means to examine the corresponding complex interactions further. Below, you'll find a few respective examples:

#### The Intersection of Race and Gender in Science Stratification

A very informative resource that allows to explore "intersectional inequalities" across fields and topics, as well as including data and methods descriptions. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://sciencebias.uni.lu/app/ " title="sciencebias" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### other material

Here's an informative Wikipedia article on  ["First-generation college students in the United States"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_college_students_in_the_United_States). While it's obviously focused on the US education system, a lot of the outlined issues/problems/obstacles/hurdles are faced by first-gen students all over the world.

## Initiatives

Please note that this list will be rather "neuroscience-focused" as it's the instructor's main field of expertise/work. However, other resources will be added asap and frequently.

### Women in Neuroscience Repository

The [Women in Neuroscience Repository](https://www.winrepo.org/) aims to "identify and recommend female neuroscientists for conferences, symposia or collaborations." via providing a fantastic interactive resource organized by a multitude of keywords.
